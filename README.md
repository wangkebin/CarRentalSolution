This is a NOT a real product. I created to learn ASP.NET on net8.0.
This car rental system manages car rental. It has the ability to check your existing reservations, make new reservations, and make payment. 

To test, you need to 
1. Update appsettings.json and point to your own Mysql or TSQL DB.
2. Run DB Migration to generate tables.
3. Manually add a new customer with FirstNname and LastName - i.e. FirstName = "Kebin", LastName = "Wang"
4. To test, run BlazorApp2 and CarRental.Presentation.
5. You can login with "FirstName Lastname" -- e.g., "Kebin Wang". DONOT forget the space in the middle
6. Have fun with it
